- 👋 Hi, I’m Oluwafemi Olobashola, and I'm passionate about turning raw data into compelling stories that drive business decisions.
  Over the years, I've honed my skills across various indistries, transforming data from simple numbers to actionable insights.
- 👀 My journey began in the world of data driven sales at the Heineken company, where I became fascinated with how data,
  when properly understood, can uncover hidden trends, streamline operations, and even predict the future. Now, I'm on a mission
  to merge Data Science with AI to solve even more complex problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently diving deep into Machine Learning and Data Visualization. Whether it's building a predictive model or crafting
  interactive dashboards, I love experimenting with new techniques that push the boundaries of what data can do.
- 💞️ Collaboration is at the heart of innovation, and I'm eager to work with like-minded individuals on projects that tap the
  power of data-driven insights, whether in Predictive Analysis, AI Modelling, or Business Intelligence
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me at femiolobashola@gmail.com. I'm always excited to connect with people who share a love for data and innovative tech.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not using data to solve business problems, I enjoy finding innovative ways to visualise data to reflect the modern world,
  combining analytics with creativity to tell stories that resonate beyond numbers.
